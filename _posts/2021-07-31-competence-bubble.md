# Competence bubble

In the learning phase, student years, people with common interest form groups or clubs. This becomes something like a bubble. For people outside, this bubble
feels elusive. For people inside, it feels like the bubble, a competence bubble, is exhaustive. If you are in one of these bubbles, you probably feel good
about yourself, you probably wouldn't consider someone outside the bubble to be good on the skill.

For people outside the bubble, you are in no way left out. Don't let the bubble make you feel little. Divorce your confidence from competence. People with
unearned confidence have done a lot of good to this world and themselves. Use that. Just, be, confident. The only thing to keep in mind is to show up every
single day, without fail, to do the task. That is all there is. Nothing else. I have seen a lot of bubbles form like this. The people inside very proud.
There isn't much different between us now. There never was. Read about [Anna Kiesenhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kiesenhofer), PhD in Mathematics and Olympics 2021 cycling champion! Can you guess
how she got there ? By showing up everyday. **It is literally impossible to not get good in something by doing it everyday. There is no force in the world
that can stop compounding.**

If you are inside a bubble, always look for people in the outside. You are losing out on opportunities if you think your next collaborator should be
from the inside. It is stupid.

In a way, even college degrees are weird bubbles, based on tests absolutely out of sync with the course. Nothing is stopping someone from learning CS, or tweaking around with electronics.
