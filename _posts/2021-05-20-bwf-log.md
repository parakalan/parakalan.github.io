# BWF Log

I have been a longtime lurker of the subreddit [r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/). It is very motivating and informative. I am starting off today with the BWF Primer from the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer). Hopefully things go as planned, I will be using this as a log for my progress.

5 sets x 5 reps Pushup.
The first set was easy, was able to do the conventional pushup. From the next set, my arms gave out, so I did 5 x 5 inclined pushup. Fingers crossed for tomorrow.
