# BWF Log

I have been a longtime lurker of the subreddit [r/bodyweightfitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/). It is very motivating and informative. I am starting off today with the BWF Primer from the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwf-primer). Hopefully things go as planned, will be using this as a log for my progress.
