This is a point by point brief of Paul Graham's [Greak Work](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) essay. It is the best of his yet, but it is also too long. I'm going to revisit it multiple times so I made this summary, using ChatGPT. This is not a substitute for the original article. This is just to read once every month so I stay on course. 

## Techniques for Doing Great Work

## The Challenge of Figuring Out What to Work On

1. **Overlapping Steps**
   - Figuring out what to work on is difficult because you can't fully understand most types of work without doing them.
   - The four steps of choosing, working, learning, and deciding overlap.

2. **Nature of Ambition**
   - Ambition can complicate the decision-making process.
   - Two forms of ambition: preceding interest and growing out of it.

3. **Educational System Limitations**
   - Educational systems often expect early commitment to a field without providing sufficient guidance.

   - Instead, focus on preserving certain invariants throughout the process.

4. **Avoid Overplanning and Stay Upwind**
   - For most people, excessive planning is not necessary.
   - Choose the most interesting and promising options at each stage.
   - Approach known as "staying upwind" is commonly used by those who have achieved great work.

## Techniques for Effective Work

1. **Working Technique**
   - Working on exciting projects is not always straightforward.
   - There are headwinds, currents, and challenges to navigate.

2. **Avoiding Overwork**
   - Working too hard can lead to diminishing returns and negative effects on health.
   - Find the optimal amount of work for each type of task.

3. **Arranging Contiguous Blocks of Time**
   - Arrange your schedule to have uninterrupted blocks of time for work.
   - Interruptions can hinder productivity and make it harder to tackle difficult tasks.

4. **Tricking Yourself to Start**
   - Starting work can be more challenging than continuing.
   - Use tricks or lies to overcome the initial threshold and get started.
   - For example, telling yourself you'll just review what you've done so far can lead to productive work.

5. **Optimism and Ignorance**
   - The young often have an advantage due to their optimism and ignorance.
   - Ignorance can sometimes be beneficial in taking on new projects.

6. **Finishing Projects**
   - Strive to finish what you start, even if it requires more work than expected.
   - The final stages of a project often yield the best work.

7. **Exaggerating Importance**
   - Exaggerating the importance of your work can help you discover something new.
   - It may not be a lie if it leads to valuable insights.

## Overcoming Procrastination

1. **Two Forms of Procrastination**
   - Per-day procrastination (within a day) and per-project procrastination (over a longer period).
   - Per-project procrastination is more dangerous and can lead to significant delays.

2. **Camouflaged Procrastination**
   - Per-project procrastination often disguises itself as work on other tasks.
   - It can go unnoticed as you appear busy with other activities.

3. **Beating Per-Project Procrastination**
   - Regularly pause and ask yourself if you are working on what you truly want to work on.
   - It becomes increasingly risky to procrastinate as you get older.

4. **Challenges of Doing What You Want**
   - Getting paid for doing exactly what you want is often difficult, especially in the early stages.
   - Two options: getting paid for work close to what you want and pushing it closer, or getting paid for something else and pursuing personal projects on the side.
   - Both approaches have drawbacks and require careful navigation.

## The Power of Consistency and Exponential Growth

1. **Engaging Work and Cumulative Effect**
   - Great work requires spending an unreasonable amount of time on a problem.
   - Finding the work engaging as it happens is crucial.
   - Consistently focusing on something you're genuinely interested in leads to surprising progress.

2. **Underestimating Cumulative Effect**
   - We underestimate the cumulative effect of work.
   - Consistency is key, even if progress seems small on a daily basis.
   - Doing something rather than nothing leads to exponential growth.

3. **Unconscious Application of Exponential Growth**
   - Many people unconsciously apply exponential growth in their endeavors.
   - Learning becomes easier as knowledge accumulates.
   - Growing an audience becomes easier as existing fans attract new ones.

4. **Underrating Exponential Growth in Early Stages**
   - Exponential growth may feel flat in the beginning, leading to underrating its potential.
   - Extraordinary effort may be required to start exponential growth.

5. **Investing in Exponential Growth**
   - Many people unconsciously invest in exponential growth.
   - If people consciously realized the potential of exponential growth, more would pursue it.

## The Power of Undirected Thinking

1. **Undirected Thinking for Problem Solving**
   - Undirected thinking during activities like walking, showering, or lying in bed can be powerful for problem-solving.
   - Letting your mind wander can lead to solving previously unsolvable problems.

2. **Interleaving Deliberate Work and Daydreaming**
   - Deliberate work that feeds questions should be interleaved with daydreaming.
   - Daydreaming alone without active work does not yield the same benefits.

3. **Avoiding Distractions**
   - Avoid distractions both during focused work and during undirected thinking.
   - Distractions can shift your focus away from important work and hinder problem-solving.

4. **Maintaining Focus**
   - When your mind wanders, it tends to focus on what you care about most at that moment.
   - Avoid distractions that push your work out of the top spot during undirected thinking.
   - Exception: Love can be a valuable focus during this type of thinking.

## Cultivating Taste and Aiming for Greatness

1. **Cultivating Taste**
   - Consciously develop your taste in the work done in your field.
   - Understanding the best work and what makes it exceptional is crucial.

2. **Aiming to Be the Best**
   - Strive to be the best in your field, as aiming for anything less may result in mediocrity.
   - Ambition to be the best is different from ambition to be good.

3. **Economy of Scale**
   - Trying to be the best often leads to a net gain rather than a burden.
   - It simplifies things and can be exciting and liberating.

4. **Creating Timeless Work**
   - Aim to create something that people will care about even after a hundred years.
   - Work that stands the test of time is more likely to be genuinely good.

## Authenticity and Identity in Work

1. **Distinctive Style**
   - Don't try to work in a distinctive style; focus on doing the best job you can.
   - Your work will naturally have a distinctive way of its own.

2. **Affectation and Fake Persona**
   - Trying to adopt a distinctive style is affectation.
   - Affectation involves pretending to be someone other than yourself in your work.
   - It can result in an impressive but fake persona that shows in the work.

3. **Avoiding Unintentional Affectation**
   - In fields like acting, where adopting a fake persona is the goal, unintentional affectation should be avoided.

4. **Authenticity and Identity**
   - The temptation to be someone else is common among the young who may feel like nobodies.
   - Working on ambitious projects solves the problem of identity.
   - Success in ambitious projects establishes your identity as the person who achieved it.
   - Focus on doing the work, and your identity will naturally take care of itself.

## The Power of Earnestness in Great Work

1. **Being Earnest**
   - Being earnest is a positive expression of avoiding affectation.
   - It involves being intellectually honest and having a sharp eye for the truth.

2. **Intellectual Honesty**
   - Intellectual honesty is crucial for seeing new ideas and truths.
   - Admitting mistakes and being willing to change one's beliefs is essential.

   - Formality and affectation divert energy from doing good work.

4. **Preserving Innocent Boldness**
   - Nerds, who preserve innocent boldness from childhood, have an advantage in doing great work.
   - Hold onto this quality and be the one who puts ideas out there.

5. **Optimism and Risk**
   - Optimism is advantageous for doing great work, even if it means risking looking like a fool at times.
   - Taking the risk of sharing ideas is essential for discovering new things.

6. **The Necessity of Earnestness**
   - Great work is difficult to achieve without earnestness.
   - Being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool distorts the work.

7. **Curing Affectation and Intellectual Dishonesty**
   - Affectation is easier to overcome than intellectual dishonesty.
   - Affectation often diminishes with time, while intellectual dishonesty is a deeper character flaw.

## Consistency, Cutting, and Elegance in Great Work

1. **Consistency and Decision-Making**
   - Great work is consistent with itself and the person who created it.
   - When facing a decision, choose the option that is more consistent with the work.

2. **Willingness to Redo and Cut**
   - Be willing to throw away and redo parts of your work if necessary.
   - Overcome status quo bias and laziness by asking if you would revert to the current state if the change had already been made.

3. **Confidence to Cut and Strip to Essence**
   - Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because of pride or effort invested.
   - Stripping work to its essence can lead to better understanding and prevent self-deception.

4. **Elegance and Mathematical Influence**
   - Mathematical elegance is a useful standard beyond math.
   - Artistic elegance often draws from mathematical elegance.
   - Laborious solutions may impress temporarily, but true elegance is long-lasting.

5. **Creation vs. Discovery**
   - Err on the side of discovery when doing work that blurs the line between creation and discovery.
   - See yourself as a conduit for ideas to take their natural shape.

6. **Gratuitously Unrestrictive Tools**
   - Build powerful tools with minimal restrictions to allow for unexpected uses.
   - Eliminating restrictions can lead to unforeseen benefits.

7. **Building on Ideas and Implications**
   - Great work often serves as a foundation for others to build upon.
   - Creating ideas that others can use or exposing questions for others to answer is a positive sign.
   - Expressing ideas in their most general form can lead to unexpected truths.

## Cultivating Originality and Curiosity

1. **True and New Ideas**
   - Great ideas must be both true and new.
   - Seeing new ideas requires a certain level of ability, even at the frontiers of knowledge.

2. **Originality as a Habit of Mind**
   - Originality is not a process but a habit of mind.
   - Original thinkers naturally generate new ideas in their areas of focus.

3. **Originality and Expertise**
   - Originality can be separated from expertise, as seen in the example of focusing on dating without much knowledge.
   - Expertise alone does not guarantee originality.

4. **Making the Most of Originality**
   - Original ideas come from working on something slightly too difficult, not from trying to have original ideas.
   - Talking or writing about interests can generate new ideas.
   - Changing context, even through a walk or travel, can stimulate new ideas.
   - Exploring different topics and using analogies can also foster originality.

5. **Distributing Attention and Curiosity**
   - Distribute attention according to a power law, focusing more on a few professionally curious topics and being idly curious about many more.

6. **Curiosity as a Creative Force**
   - Curiosity and originality are closely related.
   - Curiosity feeds originality by providing new things to explore and question.
   - Curiosity itself is a form of originality and can be a powerful creative force.

## Discovering New Ideas: Broken Models and Rule-Breaking

1. **Novelty and Obviousness**
   - Good ideas often seem simultaneously novel and obvious.
   - Once a new idea is seen, it becomes apparent and makes sense.

2. **Changing Perspectives and Broken Models**
   - Discovering new ideas requires changing the way you look at the world.
   - Our models of the world can both help and constrain us.
   - Fixing a broken model makes new ideas obvious but can be challenging.

3. **Seizing Signs of Breakage**
   - To find new ideas, pay attention to signs of broken models instead of ignoring them.
   - Most people are attached to their current models and tend to overlook these clues.

4. **Willingness to Break Rules**
   - Fixing your model of the world often involves breaking implicit rules.
   - New ideas may require breaking rules that seem obvious from the old model's perspective.

5. **The Right Kind of Crazy**
   - Good new ideas may seem crazy to most people.
   - Look for ideas that are exciting and rich in implications, rather than merely bad or depressing.

6. **Aggressively and Passively Independent-Minded**
   - Aggressively independent-minded individuals enjoy breaking rules and find energy in doing so.
   - Passively independent-minded individuals are indifferent to rules or unaware of their existence.
   - Novices, outsiders, and individuals with Asperger's syndrome may exhibit passive independent-mindedness.

7. **Strictness and Rule-Breaking**
   - Strictness and rule-breaking are not mutually exclusive.
   - In matters that truly matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.
   - Popular culture's opposition between strictness and rule-breaking is based on a broken model.

## Overcoming Filters and Exploring Overlooked Ideas

1. **Subconscious Filters and Overlooked Ideas**
   - Overlooked ideas are often dismissed by subconscious filters due to perceived risks, controversy, or effort.
   - Turning off these filters can help in recognizing and exploring new ideas.

2. **Considering Ideas for Others**
   - To bypass subconscious filters, consider what would be good ideas for someone else to explore.
   - This approach prevents self-protection mechanisms from shooting down potential ideas.

3. **Exploring Contradictions**
   - Valuable ideas can be found by examining what contradicts cherished but mistaken principles.
   - Religions, both literal and metaphorical, often contain unexplored ideas in their shadows.

4. **Questioning Cherished Principles**
   - Identify principles in your field that people are too attached to, potentially blinding them to alternative possibilities.
   - Discarding these principles can open up new possibilities for exploration.

## Choosing Problems: Overcoming Conservatism and Uncovering Potential

1. **Conservatism in Problem Selection**
   - People tend to show more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to work on.
   - Conservative choices in problem selection are influenced by risk and fashion.

2. **Undervalued Unfashionable Problems**
   - Unfashionable problems are often undervalued and overlooked.
   - Problems that are perceived as fully explored may still hold latent potential.

3. **Pleasing Aspects of Unfashionable Problems**
   - Working on unfashionable problems offers a sense of satisfaction and economy.
   - There is no hype or hurry, and existing work often has a solid foundation.

4. **Overlooked Problems of Importance**
   - Many overlooked problems are not explicitly unfashionable but are perceived as less important than they actually are.
   - Being self-indulgent and following curiosity can help uncover these overlooked problems.

5. **Importance of Originality in Problem Selection**
   - Originality in choosing problems is crucial and can lead to the discovery of new fields.
   - The initial step of deciding what to work on is key to the entire process.

## The Power of Questions: Uncovering Insights and Puzzlement

1. **Misconceptions about New Ideas**
   - Big ideas are often seen as answers, but the real insight lies in the question itself.

2. **Underrated Nature of Questions**
   - Questions are often undervalued, especially in educational settings where they are quickly answered.
   - A good question can be a partial discovery and lead to excitingly novel territory.

3. **Carrying Unanswered Questions**
   - Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable but increase the chance of noticing a solution or identifying connections between questions.

4. **The Importance of Youthful Questions**
   - Returning to questions from childhood or earlier can lead to great work.
   - Keeping youthful questions alive is as important as keeping youthful dreams alive.

5. **Puzzlement and Originality**
   - Originality involves being puzzled and comfortable with confusion.
   - Experts are often puzzled, and the presence of unanswered questions indicates matters of importance.

6. **The Richness of Unanswered Questions**
   - Being rich in unanswered questions is valuable, as questions lead not only to answers but also to more questions.
   - Trying to answer existing questions is a fruitful way to acquire new questions.

## Starting Small and Evolving: Prolific Curiosity and Successive Versions

1. **Promiscuous Curiosity and Starting Small**
   - Be promiscuously curious and pull on various threads to see what happens.
   - Big things often start small, with experiments, side projects, or talks.

2. **The Value of Being Prolific**
   - Trying many different things increases the chance of discovering something new.
   - Embrace the fact that trying lots of things means encountering both good and bad ideas.

3. **Successive Versions and Evolution**
   - Great things are typically made in successive versions.
   - Start with something small and evolve it, resulting in a cleverer and more ambitious final version.

4. **Getting Feedback and Iterating**
   - Get an initial version of a project in front of people quickly and evolve it based on their response.
   - Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.

5. **The Significance of Being Dismissed as a "Toy"**
   - Being dismissed as a "toy" for an early version of a project is a good sign.
   - It indicates that the idea has potential and only lacks scale, which can follow.

6. **Planning vs. Evolution**
   - Planning is often seen as more responsible, but starting small and evolving designs works better.
   - Planning is a necessary evil in response to inflexible media or coordination needs.
   - Keeping projects small and using flexible media allows for less planning and more evolutionary design.

## Embracing Risk and Valuing Failure

1. **Risk and Reward**
   - In an efficient market, risk is proportional to reward.
   - Look for bets with high expected value rather than certainty.

2. **Avoiding Excessive Conservatism**
   - Failing occasionally is a sign of taking appropriate risks.
   - Being too conservative limits potential growth and opportunities.

3. **The Mistake of Youthful Conservatism**
   - Inexperience often leads young individuals to fear risk.
   - However, when young, one can afford to take more risks.

4. **The Value of Failed Projects**
   - Even failed projects have value.
   - Working on them exposes you to unique experiences and questions that few others have encountered.

5. **Questions from Challenging Endeavors**
   - Trying to accomplish something slightly beyond your capabilities generates valuable questions.
   - These questions become a rich source of learning and growth.

## Leveraging Youth and Age: Time, Curiosity, and Fresh Perspectives

1. **Advantages of Youth**
   - Energy, time, optimism, and freedom are advantages of youth.
   - Use these advantages to learn, explore, and develop skills.

2. **Advantages of Age**
   - Knowledge, efficiency, money, and power are advantages of age.
   - Acquire knowledge and resources when young and retain the advantages of youth when old.

3. **The Value of Time**
   - Youth often underestimates the richness of time.
   - Use time in slightly frivolous ways to learn, build, and excel.

4. **Avoiding Time Wasting**
   - Distinguish between activities that may seem like a waste of time but have potential value and those that are truly wasteful.
   - Focus on producing rather than consuming.

5. **Fresh Perspectives of Inexperience**
   - Inexperience allows for seeing things with fresh eyes.
   - Pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing when learning something new.

6. **Revisiting Misgivings**
   - Set aside initial misgivings temporarily to keep progressing.
   - Revisit and evaluate them later to uncover potential undiscovered ideas.

## Overcoming Inexperience and Schooling Misconceptions

1. **Knowing What to Worry About**
   - Inexperience leads to equal worry about everything, lacking the ability to prioritize.
   - Focus more on a few important things and worry less about the rest.

2. **Clearing Nonsense from Inexperience**
   - Inexperience comes with acquired bad habits and false teachings.
   - Great work requires clearing away the nonsense hindering progress.

3. **Schools and Passivity**
   - Schools often induce passivity, with authority figures dictating what to learn and measuring performance.
   - Overcome passivity by considering education as your project and teachers as advisors.

4. **Misleading Impression of Work**
   - Schools provide a misleading impression of work by presenting solvable problems within taught boundaries.
   - Real-life work involves identifying problems and their solvability.

5. **Hacking the Test Mentality**
   - Schools train students to win by hacking tests, which is not conducive to great work.
   - Focus on overlooked problems and solutions rather than seeking shortcuts.

## Independence and Rejection: Focusing on Good Work

1. **Avoiding Dependency on Gatekeepers**
   - Don't rely on a "big break" from influential individuals.
   - Focus on doing good work instead of chasing after them.

2. **Not Taking Committee Rejection Personally**
   - Rejection by committees should not be taken to heart.
   - The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees differ from those required for great work.

3. **Limited Meaning of Selection Committees**
   - Selection committee decisions are only meaningful if part of a feedback loop, which is rare.
   - Don't let committee rejections discourage or define your potential for success.

## The Art of Copying and Learning from Others

1. **Copying as a Learning Tool**
   - Copying existing work is a valuable way to learn and understand how things work.
   - Copying does not necessarily make your work unoriginal; originality is the presence of new ideas.

2. **The Good and Bad Ways of Copying**
   - Copy openly rather than furtively or unconsciously.
   - "Great artists steal" refers to openly and consciously learning from others.

3. **Copying as a Sign of Superiority**
   - Copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.
   - Early work is often based on previous work, and this is natural in the beginning stages.

4. **The Novelty of Ideas and Conceptual Vocabulary**
   - Novel ideas may initially seem derivative due to the lack of conceptual vocabulary to express them.
   - New discoveries often start as variations of existing things.

5. **Dangers of Copying**
   - Copying old things that were once at the frontier of knowledge can be limiting.
   - Avoid copying every feature, as some may be inappropriate or outdated.

6. **Learning from Different Fields**
   - Copying from one field into another can be a powerful way to innovate.
   - Deliberately learning about other kinds of work can inspire new ideas.

7. **Negative Examples and Missing Elements**
   - Negative examples and flaws can be as inspiring and informative as positive ones.
   - Sometimes, understanding what is missing or done poorly helps clarify what is needed.

## Benefits of Visiting Centers of Excellence

1. **Increasing Ambition and Self-Confidence**
   - Visiting a place with many top professionals in your field can boost your ambition.
   - Seeing that these experts are human can increase your self-confidence.

2. **Welcoming Environment for Genuine Interest**
   - Earnest individuals are likely to receive a warm welcome from experts.
   - Most people who excel in their work enjoy discussing it with genuinely interested individuals.

3. **Effort in Finding the Best**

   - Polite fictions exist in certain places, like universities, where not everyone is engaged in great work.

4. **Varying Quality of Work**
   - The quality of work in different departments within universities can vary immensely.
   - Some departments have individuals doing great work, while others have in the past or never have.

## The Importance of Quality Colleagues and Collaboration

1. **Seeking the Best Colleagues**
   - Collaborate with the best colleagues who can contribute to your work and provide support.
   - Having colleagues to bounce ideas off and receive encouragement is valuable.

2. **Influence of Colleagues**
   - Your colleagues not only impact your work but also shape you as an individual.
   - Work with people you aspire to become like.

3. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Having a few great colleagues is more important than having many average ones.
   - History suggests that colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.

4. **Identifying Sufficiently Good Colleagues**
   - Sufficiently good colleagues offer surprising insights and can do things you can't.
   - If you have a handful of colleagues who keep you on your toes in this sense, you likely have good colleagues.

5. **Collaboration on Larger Projects**
   - Some projects require collaboration on a larger scale.
   - Managing such projects requires aptitude and interest in management.

6. **Learning Management or Avoiding Large Projects**
   - If you lack aptitude and interest in management, you must either force yourself to learn it or avoid large projects.
   - Exceptions exist for projects with highly constrained tasks or defined protocols.

## Nurturing Morale and Perseverance in Ambitious Projects

1. **The Importance of Morale**
   - Morale is the foundation for success in ambitious projects.
   - It should be nurtured and protected like a living organism.

2. **Optimism and Luck**
   - Optimism increases the likelihood of doing great work.
   - Viewing oneself as lucky rather than a victim also enhances productivity.

3. **Work as a Refuge**
   - Engaging in pure work can serve as an escape from everyday life difficulties.
   - This productive form of escapism has been utilized by great minds throughout history.

4. **The Morale-Work Cycle**
   - High morale leads to good work, which further boosts morale for even better work.
   - Conversely, a lack of good work can demoralize and hinder progress.

5. **Switching to Easier Work**
   - When stuck, switching to easier work can help regain momentum and start accomplishing tasks.
   - It is important to keep the morale-work cycle running in the right direction.

6. **Setbacks and Backtracking**
   - Setbacks should be considered a natural part of the process.
   - Solving hard problems often involves backtracking and trying again.

7. **Perseverance and Learning**
   - "Never give up" is not entirely accurate; there are times when it's necessary to eject.
   - Avoid panicking and backtracking excessively due to setbacks.
   - Learn to distinguish between good pain (effort) and bad pain (damage).

## Audience, Relationships, and Physical Well-being in Maintaining Morale

1. **The Value of an Audience**
   - An audience, whether peers or traditional, is crucial for morale.
   - The size of the audience does not need to be large; a small but dedicated audience can sustain you.

2. **Avoiding Intermediaries**
   - Whenever possible, avoid intermediaries between you and your audience.
   - Direct engagement with your audience is liberating and preferable.

3. **Influential People in Your Life**
   - Surround yourself with people who increase your energy and morale.
   - Be mindful of the effect individuals have on your overall well-being.

4. **Supportive Relationships**
   - Choose a partner who understands and supports your need to work.
   - Avoid individuals who view your work as competition for attention.

5. **Physical Well-being**
   - Morale is connected to physical well-being, so take care of your body.
   - Regular exercise, proper nutrition, and sufficient sleep are essential.
   - Running and walking are particularly beneficial for thinking.

6. **Productivity and Happiness**
   - Smart and ambitious individuals who are not productive tend to become bitter.
   - Being productive is important for the happiness and fulfillment of intelligent and ambitious individuals.

## Choosing the Right People and Following Curiosity

1. **Impressing the Right People**
   - It's natural to want to impress others, but choose the right individuals.
   - The opinion of people you respect is valuable, while fame adds noise.

2. **Prestige and Trailing Indicators**
   - The prestige of a type of work is not a reliable indicator of its worth.
