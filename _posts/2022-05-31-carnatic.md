Hi there! I am planning to write a series of articles on some problems I plan to solve with code.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There must be an effort to digitize all known Carnatic songs with notations / variations etc. Something like a full fledged search engine for that. For example, I should be able to search for a sequence of swaras and be able to get matching krithis or parts of them.</p>&mdash; Sudharsan (@parakalakavi) <a href="https://twitter.com/parakalakavi/status/1530581285067862017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
