title: Why I should be VC
---

This is a post directed to me. 

I will open it later when I actually join a VC firm, if I am able to, or if I fail to join or become a VC.

I am going to list all the things I think I am good at, and come to a conclusion of what kind of job I will do.

1. I like to work on interesting problems. I like to get tasks done, whether they are related to me or not. It is just interesting to me to solve problems, whatever the context maybe. I just like the feel of a solved problem. I will love to get working with founders facing any Tech or non-Tech problem. I can be an underling when required, I have zero ego when work needs to be done. I can sweep the office and write code if required. 

2. I cannot fixate one a problem for too long. I cannot work on a single thing for years. I am not good at that. This rules out research or building a long running company. 

3. I prefer be more independent in work. I cannot listen and say "Yes" all the time.

4. I talk to many people and remember events and context, a lot. I can recollect random facts from memory. I am not absent minded.

5. I do not have limits to what I want to learn. Any new learning is interesting to me. I can read a Wikipedia page on ancient democracy in India and also about Cafe Wha? in NYC. I just have no limits to knowing.

6. I can get a sense of people pretty quickly. I can figure out who is transparent and who isn't, who is a good collaborator and who isn't within some time of interacting.

Given all these positives and negatives, I think a Venture Capitalist is a good job to go ahead with. I am at a place where I can take risk. I love risk.
