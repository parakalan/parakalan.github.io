# Gaza: What's Actually Happening

## The Numbers Are Clear
- 80% of homes damaged or destroyed
- Only 17 of 36 hospitals partially working
- All universities destroyed
- 1.9 million people displaced
- Almost every Gazan knows multiple people who died

## The Scale is Staggering
Let me put this in perspective - imagine if everything between Indiranagar and Koramangala was rubbled, and the entire population of Bangalore was forced into an area the size of Jayanagar. That's Gaza right now. 43,000+ dead - that's like losing everyone in Whitefield.

## I Was Wrong About This Initially
Like many, I was skeptical at first. Having seen fake propaganda about Kashmir (which I know isn't genocide), I was wary. But the evidence here is overwhelming and comes from multiple credible sources.

## The Real Lessons of History
When we say "Never Again" after the Holocaust, it wasn't meant to be selective. The core lesson wasn't just about antisemitism - it was about the fundamental wrong of systematic dehumanization and mass killing of any people. It was about creating international laws and institutions to prevent the powerful from destroying the powerless with impunity.

Yet today:
- Valid humanitarian concerns are being dismissed as antisemitism
- International law violations are justified through security needs
- The trauma of the Holocaust is being weaponized to deflect accountability
- The very institutions created to prevent such atrocities are being dismissed

When Netanyahu says "No one will stop us, not The Hague," it reveals a dangerous belief in being above the very international legal framework created in response to the Holocaust. The bitter irony is that these institutions, born from humanity's commitment to prevent systematic killing of civilians, are now being ignored when they raise alarms about Gaza.

This isn't about Jewish people - many Jewish individuals and organizations strongly oppose these actions. It's about power, impunity, and how historical victimization is being used to justify actions that mirror what those post-Holocaust institutions were meant to prevent.

## This Isn't About Religion
This is about power dynamics. The powerful crushing the powerless - a pattern we've seen repeatedly. Like what happened in Bangladesh, or in Kashmir in 1991 when militants backed by power forced an entire community of Pandits to flee their homes. The common thread isn't religion - it's the abuse of power to target vulnerable populations. Today in Gaza, we see this same dynamic: Israel has nuclear weapons, a modern military, and US backing. Gaza has no army, no control over its borders, not even reliable electricity.

## The UN Isn't Biased Here
Think about it - why would an organization of 193 countries, with different religions, political systems, and interests, all align unless something is seriously wrong? Israel's dismissal of all international institutions should concern us.

## The October 7 Context
Yes, Hamas's attack was horrific. 1,200 Israelis died. But this response (43,000+ Palestinians dead) isn't justice - it's vengeance at a genocidal scale. And it comes after years of blockade and occupation.

## International Response is Shifting
Even traditional Israeli supporters are speaking up. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to prevent genocide. This isn't just activist talk anymore.

## My Learning - As Always, Facts Matter
a) Independent voices like Nassim Taleb and Bruno Macaes are speaking up
b) UN agencies consistently reporting humanitarian crisis
c) Israeli officials' own words about "human animals" and "Gaza won't return to what it was"

## Breaking Cycles of Violence
The Holocaust was one of history's darkest moments. It's deeply tragic that a nation born from that trauma is now being accused of inflicting similar dehumanization on others. The same language about "vermin" and "human animals" that we studied in history books is being used again, by the people who were called "vermin" and "human animals".

What we're seeing in Gaza isn't just about current deaths and destruction. It's creating deep psychological wounds that will affect generations:
- Children growing up under bombardment
- Entire families being erased
- Communities destroyed
- Trust in international institutions shattered
- Collective trauma being formed

## This Will Have Long-Term Consequences
Just as we look back at historical atrocities and wonder how they were allowed to happen, future generations will judge this moment. The world is watching and documenting everything.

The real challenge is: how do we break this cycle of trauma and violence? When powerful nations can ignore international law, when civilian deaths become "collateral damage," when children's deaths are justified - we're setting dangerous precedents for the future of all humanity, not just one region or group.
