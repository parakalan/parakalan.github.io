My father passed away on December 7, 2025 at Kauvery Hospital, Electronic City, Bangalore. He was 66. He was in the hospital for about 10 days, in and out of ICU. Dad was admitted for bradycardia (low HR) and was on a temporary pacemaker when he passed.


He left conscious and fulfilled. Two days before, with remarkable clarity, he blessed everyone, said "I don't have enough time, take care of everyone," and chose to stop dialysis after 16 years. "Today I am clear. I don't know about tomorrow. So ask me anything," he told us. When asked about unfulfilled wishes, he said "I am very fulfilled." He told my mom she took very good care of him through the years - something everyone who knew them affirmed. He told me - “Do the initial rituals in Bangalore, do the rest in Srirangam”


Dad came from poverty and worked his way up. Even in his delirium, he kept repeating "My son is from NIT Trichy" and talked about my car. He was proud of me knowing all of Divya Prabandham. His joy was seeing me rise beyond the circumstances he was born into.
Among other things, he gave me what no amount of money can buy - a foundation in bhakti, connection to Perumal, and the Divya Prabandham. These are things no one else can give me, and I can never earn for myself. In his confused moments, he was back in Tiruvindhalur doing kainkaryam. 


He passed peacefully at 2:45 PM while I ran my fingers through his forehead, his beloved nephew Ranga by his side, both of us reciting Divya Prabandham pasurams. No struggle, just a gradual, conscious release.
When we immersed his ashes in the Kaveri at Srirangapatna, three Garudas circled overhead, then flew away.


He lived by his principles and left on his own terms, like Bhismacharya.
