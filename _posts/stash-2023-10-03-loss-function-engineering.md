Loss Functions in Deep Learning: Exploring Focal Loss

Loss functions are fundamental to deep learning. They guide the optimization algorithms, indicating how well or poorly our predictions are compared to the actual outcomes. While there are standard loss functions that work for most tasks, certain challenges in machine learning require specialized functions. One such challenge is class imbalance, which leads us to our primary focus: Focal Loss.

Focal Loss: Addressing Class Imbalance

Class imbalance is pervasive in various machine learning tasks. For instance, in datasets where one class dominates, models tend to get biased towards the majority class. This bias results in poor performance for the minority class, which is often of significant interest in tasks like fraud detection or rare disease identification.

To combat this, Focal Loss was introduced.

Origins of Focal Loss

The concept of Focal Loss was proposed in the "Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection" paper by Tsung-Yi Lin and his team. Designed to enhance the standard cross-entropy loss, Focal Loss's primary goal is to give more weight to the misclassified examples, ensuring the model pays more attention to them during training.

How Focal Loss Works

Focal Loss tweaks the cross-entropy loss by introducing a modulating factor. This factor reduces the weight for well-classified examples, ensuring they don't dominate the training process. In contrast, misclassified instances, especially those from the minority class, are given more emphasis, allowing the model to focus more on them.
