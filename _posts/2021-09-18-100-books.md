"I donâ€™t want to read everything. I just want to read the 100 great books over and over again." - @illacertus

This post is based on the above tweet. I hope to find my list of 100 great books.

1. The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.

This is a no-brainer for me. The best thing that happened last year was me finding Naval on Twitter. This book is all of Naval's thoughts, in a sense. It is a collection of very brief sentences, based on the tweets of Naval.
