I stumble into one idea or the other from time to time. My ideas are probably worth less than dime a dozen, but that is not going to stop me from documenting them.

Part of the reason why I am documenting, is that, when you write down thoughts it becomes much more clear. So many gaps are removed. If you cannot express the idea well, it is probably not a good idea, or you haven't thought enought about it.

So I am starting now, to write down product ideas, startup ideas and just repository ideas even. 

Feel free to pick any of these ideas to implement, or ping me if you want to collaborate on anything, I am always up to working with new people.
