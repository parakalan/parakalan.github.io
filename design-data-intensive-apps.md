title: Designing Data Intensive Applications
---

I will try to summarise the chapters of [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://amzn.to/3nPiwOj) in a series of posts. I am a junior engineer and a learner, so if you find anything wrong, just raise a PR or ping me on Twitter. You should really buy the book for complete learning. These posts are not intended to replace them, these are just points I feel are important, or in a sense, learnable.
